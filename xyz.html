        <p>Flowers are the reproductive structures of flowering plants (angiosperms) and are essential for their reproduction. They come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, attracting pollinators like insects and birds, and are crucial for seed production. Flowers have both male and female parts (stamens and pistils respectively) and, after pollination, develop into fruits and seeds. </p>
